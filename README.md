# cs50: 1st Half
This repository holds coding work from the first half of Harvard's cs50:

cs50 is Harvard's intro to computer science course, freely available to all online.

### [**Week 0**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/0/)
Week 0 introduces some basic computer science concepts, including binary and how that is translated into letters with ASCII, algorithms, types of searches, big O notation, and pseudocode. Programming starts with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), a cute visual programming language.
 
Problem set 0: Students created a functioning program with Scratch. I created a simple video game.

### [**Week 1**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/1/)
Week 1 introduces the C programming language, including basic functions, variables, conditionals, loops, comments, operators and date types. Also covered were basic use of the terminal and linux commands.  
 
*Lab 1* involved creating a program to calculate the length of time it would take for a population to reach a size chosen by the user.  

*Problem Set 1* included programs to print "hello,world", display "#" as a simulation of displaying blocks in a Mario game, and implementing a change calculator.

### [**Week 2**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/2/)

Week 2 covers topics including how compiling works, debugging methods (debuggers, print(), rubber duck), arrays, strings being an array of char's, taking command line arguments (in C), exit status, and basic concepts of cryptography.

*Lab 2* implemented an application that compared the value of two words in Scrabble, and tells the user which has a higher base score.

*Problem Set 2* included Bulbs: a program to display a user-provided message in binary, Caesar: a program to encrypt a message using Caesar's cypher, and Readability: a program that assigns a reading level (e.g. Grade 10) to a given text.
