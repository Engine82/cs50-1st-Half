[**Week 0**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/0/) introduces some basic computer science concepts, including binary and how that is translated into letters with ASCII, algorithms, types of searches, big O notation, and pseudocode. Programming starts with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), a cute visual programming language.
Problem set 0: Students created a functioning program with Scratch. I created a simple video game.
